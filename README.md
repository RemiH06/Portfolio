### Welcome!
Here you will find the projects I'm currently working on as well as the ones I've done along time. Even though my career is oriented to data, most of my repos are software products and cover many more things than just data.

## Currently working on:

- This very repo!
- [GitHub Wrapped](https://github.com/HectorH06/GitHub-Wrapped)
- [Ryoko](https://github.com/HectorH06/Ryoko)
- Tacology (coming soon)
- Mapo (coming soon)
- Javis (coming soon)
